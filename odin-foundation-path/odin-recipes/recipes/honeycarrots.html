        Whether you need a tasty side dish for your holiday dinner or simply for
        a weeknight meal, Honey Roasted Carrots are an amazing choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The glazed carrots are sweet enough that your picky eaters won't even
        realize they're veggies â€” and you'll feel great knowing they're getting
        some nutrients. Plus, they're oh-so-easy to make! It doesn't get much
        better than that.
